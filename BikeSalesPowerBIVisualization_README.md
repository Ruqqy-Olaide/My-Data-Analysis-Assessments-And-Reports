Title -
Bike Sales Power BI Dashboard

Introduction-
•	Objective: The aim of this analysis is to explore purchasing patterns for bikes based on demographic factors such as homeownership, region, education, occupation, commute distance, and income. 

•	Context: The dataset analyzed in this Power BI dashboard contains information on customers who have either purchased or not purchased a bike, segmented by various demographic attributes. Understanding these patterns can help businesses target specific customer groups more effectively.

•	Data Sources: The data is visualized in a Power BI dashboard, showing metrics related to the number of bikes purchased, average income, and customer segmentation based on commute distance, education level, and occupation.

Data Understanding-
•	Data Description:
The dashboard provides insights into the following key areas:
o	Home Ownership: Whether the customer owns a home or not.
o	Region: Geographic segmentation (North America, Europe, Pacific).
o	Income: The average income of customers, segmented by commute distance and bike purchase status.
o	Commute Distance: How far the customer commutes (e.g., 0-1 miles, 10+ miles).
o	Education: The highest level of education achieved (e.g., Bachelors, Graduate Degree).
o	Occupation: The type of job held by the customer (e.g., Professional, Skilled Manual).

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Purchased Bike by Home Ownership:
-	Out of the total participants, 697 home owners purchased bikes compared to 329 non-homeowners. This indicates a significant difference in purchasing behavior based on home ownership.
o	Purchased Bike by Region:
-	The North America region leads in bike purchases with 220 units, followed by Europe (156) and Pacific (119).
o	Average Income by Commute Distance:
-	Customers who commute 10+ miles have the highest average income, with those purchasing bikes averaging $82K and those not purchasing averaging $72K.
  
Methodology -
•	Data Preprocessing:
o	The data was visualized in Power BI, where it was segmented by various demographic factors such as region, home ownership, education, occupation, and commute distance.

•	Analytical Approach:
o	The dashboard focused on examining the relationships between purchasing behavior and various demographic factors. 

•	Assumptions:
o	It is assumed that the dataset is representative of the overall market for bike sales.
o	Homeownership, region, and commute distance are assumed to be key drivers behind purchasing decisions.

Analysis -
•	Results:
o	Home Ownership:
-	A higher number of homeowners purchased bikes compared to non-homeowners, suggesting that home ownership may be a factor that influences purchasing behavior.
o	Region:
-	North America leads in the number of bike purchases, indicating that this region might be a strong market for bike sales.
o	Commute Distance and Income:
-	Customers with longer commute distances (10+ miles) tend to have higher average incomes, and they are also more likely to purchase bikes. This suggests a potential target market for higher-income commuters.
o	Education:
-	Customers with a Bachelors degree are the largest group of bike purchasers, with 311 purchases. Other significant groups include those with Partial College education and Graduate Degrees.
o	Occupation:
-	Professionals and skilled manual workers make up the bulk of bike purchasers, with 280 and 259 purchases respectively. This indicates that certain occupational categories may have a higher propensity to purchase bikes.
  
•	Interpretation:
o	Homeownership, region, and commute distance are significant factors in bike purchasing decisions. The data suggests that bike sales are higher among homeowners, North Americans, and individuals with longer commutes and higher incomes.
o	Education and occupation also play a role in purchasing behavior, with customers holding higher educational degrees and working in professional or skilled manual jobs more likely to purchase bikes.

•	Validation:
o	The insights from the dashboard align with general market trends, where higher income and homeownership are often linked to purchasing higher-cost items like bikes. 

Conclusion -
•	Summary of Findings:
o	Homeownership plays a significant role in purchasing behavior, with homeowners more likely to purchase bikes.
o	The North America region is a leading market for bike sales based on the dataset.
o	Customers with longer commute distances and higher incomes are more likely to purchase bikes, making them a key target segment.
o	Educational background and occupation also influence purchasing decisions, with professionals and skilled manual workers showing higher purchase rates.
•	Recommendations:
o	Focus marketing efforts on homeowners, particularly in the North America region, as they are more likely to purchase bikes.
o	Targeting customers with longer commute distances and higher incomes, as these individuals show a strong propensity to buy.
•	Limitations:
o	The dataset is limited in scope and may not represent global bike purchasing trends.
