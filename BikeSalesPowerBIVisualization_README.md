1. Title: Bike Sales Power BI Dashboard

2. Introduction:

•	Objective: The aim of this analysis is to explore purchasing patterns for bikes based on demographic factors such as homeownership, region, education, occupation, commute distance, and income. 

•	Context: The dataset analyzed in this Power BI dashboard contains information on customers who have either purchased or not purchased a bike, segmented by various demographic attributes. Understanding these patterns can help businesses target specific customer groups more effectively.

•	Data Sources: The data was obtained from Kaggle, a database platform and visualized with the aid of Power BI dashboard, showing metrics related to the number of bikes purchased, average income, and customer segmentation based on commute distance, education level, and occupation.

3. Data Understanding:
   
•	Data Description:

The dashboard provides insights into the following key areas:
-	Home Ownership: Whether the customer owns a home or not.
-	Region: Geographic segmentation (North America, Europe, Pacific).
-	Income: The average income of customers, segmented by commute distance and bike purchase status.
-	Commute Distance: How far the customer commutes (e.g. 0-1 miles, 10+ miles).
-	Education: The highest level of education achieved (e.g. Bachelors, Graduate Degree).
-	Occupation: The type of job held by the customer (e.g. Professional, Skilled Manual).

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-   Purchased Bike by Home Ownership: Out of the total participants, 697 home owners purchased bikes compared to 329 non-homeowners. This indicates a significant difference in purchasing behavior based on home ownership.
  
-   Purchased Bike by Region: The North America region leads in bike purchases with 220 units, followed by Europe (156) and Pacific (119).
  
- Average Income by Commute Distance: Customers who commute 10+ miles have the highest average income, with those purchasing bikes averaging $82K and those not purchasing averaging $72K.
  
4. Methodology:
   
•	Data Preprocessing:
-	The data was visualized in Power BI, where it was segmented by various demographic factors such as region, home ownership, education, occupation, and commute distance.

•	Analytical Approach:
-	The dashboard focused on examining the relationships between purchasing behavior and various demographic factors. 

•	Assumptions:
-   It is assumed that the dataset is representative of the overall market for bike sales.
-	Homeownership, region, and commute distance are assumed to be key drivers behind purchasing decisions.

5. Analysis:

•	Results:

-	Home Ownership: A higher number of homeowners purchased bikes compared to non-homeowners, suggesting that home ownership may be a factor that influences purchasing behavior.
  
-  Region: North America leads in the number of bike purchases, indicating that this region might be a strong market for bike sales.
  
-	Commute Distance and Income: Customers with longer commute distances (10+ miles) tend to have higher average incomes, and they are also more likely to purchase bikes. This suggests a potential target market for higher-income commuters.
  
-	Education: Customers with a Bachelors degree are the largest group of bike purchasers, with 311 purchases. Other significant groups include those with Partial College education and Graduate Degrees.
  
-	Occupation: Professionals and skilled manual workers make up the bulk of bike purchasers, with 280 and 259 purchases respectively. This indicates that certain occupational categories may have a higher propensity to purchase bikes.
  
•	Interpretation:

-	Homeownership, region, and commute distance are significant factors in bike purchasing decisions. The data suggests that bike sales are higher among homeowners, North Americans, and individuals with longer commutes and higher incomes.
  
-	Education and occupation also play a role in purchasing behavior, with customers holding higher educational degrees and working in professional or skilled manual jobs more likely to purchase bikes.

•	Validation:

-	The insights from the dashboard align with general market trends, where higher income and homeownership are often linked to purchasing higher-cost items like bikes. 

6. Conclusion:
   
•	Summary of Findings:

-	Homeownership plays a significant role in purchasing behavior, with homeowners more likely to purchase bikes.
  
-	The North America region is a leading market for bike sales based on the dataset.
  
-	Customers with longer commute distances and higher incomes are more likely to purchase bikes, making them a key target segment.
  
-	Educational background and occupation also influence purchasing decisions, with professionals and skilled manual workers showing higher purchase rates.
  
•	Recommendations:

-	It is recommended that marketing efforts be focused on homeowners, particularly in the North America region, as they are more likely to purchase bikes.
  
-	Targeting customers with longer commute distances and higher incomes, as these individuals show a strong propensity to buy.
  
•	Limitations:

-	The dataset is limited in scope and may not represent global bike purchasing trends.
